# Contact-Tracing-App

## *About the Program*

*Crafted through Python, this simple application asks user for information necessary for contact tracing and creates a text file containing such content which is then stored in a directory for easier navigation.
The user will be able to add and search entries through this application.*

- *To run this program, the user simply needs to run the first two programs to see the output and put in required values for pet details to print the collected information.*

## *Demo*
Below is a quick demo of the program:
